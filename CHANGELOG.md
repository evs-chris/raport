## 0.0.2

2019-10-09

#### Package

* Added the license (MIT).
* The typings should now be properly set up in the package manifest.

#### Data

* The built-in operators are now all kebab-cased to play nicely with expressions.
* The `Parameter` type is now extendable.
* Sorting and filtering can both be done with full expressions rather than a fixed array or operation application respectively.
* The `Root` context class will now accept and `ExtendOptions` object to initialize parameters and special refs.

#### Report

* Paged reports now include `@page` style size that makes generating pdfs with puppeteer pretty painless.
* The repeater can now use an expression as a source.
* The report runner `run` function will now accept parameters or a context rather than just parameters.
* Reports may specify initialization data for the root context as part of their definition.
* `delimited` reports can now have the same `sources` specified as displayed reports. The main source can optionally be specified by name using `source`, and if none is provided, the first source from `sources` is used.
